                                    <p class="mb-30">AWS, or Amazon Web Services, is a cloud computing service used in
                                        many businesses for storage, analytics, applications, deployment services, and
                                        many others. It’s a platform utilizes several services to support business in a
                                        serverless way with pay-as-you-go schemes.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Machine learning modeling activity is also one of the activities that AWS
                                        supports. With several services, modeling activities can be supported, such as
                                        developing the model to making it into production. AWS has shown versatility,
                                        which is essential for any business that needs scalability and speed.
                                        <br><br>
                                        This article will discuss deploying a machine learning model in the AWS cloud
                                        into production. How could we do that? Let’s explore further.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>Preparation</h5>
                                    <p class="mb-30">
                                        Before you start this tutorial, you need to create an AWS account, as we would
                                        need them to access all the AWS services. I assume that the reader would use the
                                        free tier to follow this article. Additionally, I assume the reader already
                                        knows how to use Python programming language and has basic knowledge of machine
                                        learning. Also, we will focus on the model deployment part and will not
                                        concentrate on other aspects of data science activity, such as data
                                        preprocessing and model evaluation.
                                        <br><br>
                                        With that in mind, we will start our journey of deploying your machine learning
                                        model in the AWS Cloud services.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="mb-30">
                                        In this tutorial, we will develop a machine-learning model to predict churn from
                                        the given data. The training dataset is acquired from Kaggle, which you can
                                        download here.
                                        <br><br>
                                        After we have acquired the dataset, we would create an S3 bucket to store the
                                        dataset. Search the S3 in the AWS services and make the bucket.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="mb-30">
                                        After you have finished creating the bucket and uploading the data into your
                                        bucket, we will go to the AWS SageMaker service. In this service, we will use
                                        the Studio as our working environment. If you have never used the Studio, let’s
                                        create a domain and user before proceeding further.
                                        <br><br>
                                        First, choose the Domains within the Amazon SageMaker Admin configurations.
                                        <br><br>
                                        In the Domains, you would see a lot of buttons to select. In this screen, select
                                        the Create domain button.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Choose the quick setup if you want to speed up the creation process. After it’s
                                        finished, you should see a new domain created in the dashboard. Select the new
                                        domain you just created and then click the Add user button.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Next, you should name the user profile according to your preferences. For the
                                        execution role, you can leave it on default for now, as it’s the one that was
                                        created during the Domain creation process.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Just click next until the canvas setting. In this section, I turn off several
                                        settings that we don’t need, such as Time Series Forecasting.
                                        <br><br>
                                        After everything is set, go to the studio selection and select the Open studio
                                        button with the user name you just created.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Inside the Studio, navigate to the sidebar that looks like a folder icon and
                                        create a new notebook there. We can let them by default, like the image below.
                                        <br><br>
                                        With the new notebook, we would work to create a churn prediction model and
                                        deploy the model into API inferences that we can use in production.
                                        <br><br>
                                        First, let’s import the necessary package and read the churn data.
                                        <br><br>
                                        With our dataset ready, we would now develop a churn prediction model and deploy
                                        them. In the AWS, we often use a script training method for machine learning
                                        training. That’s why we would develop a script before starting the training.
                                        <br><br>
                                        For the next step, we need to create an additional Python file, which I called
                                        train.py, in the same folder.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Inside this file, we would set our model development process to create the churn
                                        model.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Next, we would use the parser method to control the variable that we can input
                                        into our training process. The overall code that we would put in our script to
                                        train our model is in the code below.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Lastly, we need to put four different functions that SageMaker requires to make
                                        inferences: model_fn, input_fn, output_fn, and predict_fn.
                                        With our script ready, we would run the training process. In the next step, we
                                        would pass the script we created above into the SKLearn estimator. This
                                        estimator is a Sagemaker object that would handle the entire training process,
                                        and we would only need to pass all the parameters similar to the code below.
                                    </p>
