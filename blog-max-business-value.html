                                        (GenAI) compared to the past? Think about it: ChatGPT launched in 2022 and
                                        gained 100 million users in two months. In comparison, we have been hearing
                                        about AI for a few years, but the adoption rates of AI have varied from 25% to
                                        35% (based on different research). This in itself shows the ease with which
                                        GenAI tools are being used to augment existing business processes, boost
                                        productivity, and provide benefits at most of the organizational nodes.

                                        Given that we’re roughly dealing with something whose age is quantifiable in
                                        months rather than years, the final goal and tangible solutions might be a
                                        little far, but the initial POCs and experiments have sparked innovation and are
                                        forcing people to think fundamentally differently about how businesses work.

                                    <blockquote>But the question most executives ask these days is: “Where to start and
                                        how to use it to our advantage?”
                                    </blockquote>
                                    <h5>The GenAI Playbook: Going Back to the Whiteboard</h5>
                                    <p class="mb-30">
                                        The global generative AI market is approaching an inflection point, with a
                                        valuation of $8 billion and an estimated CAGR of 34.6% by 2030. Even Gartner has
                                        placed GenAI at the peak of inflated expectations in their hype cycle. Most
                                        research reports highlight nearly 50-70% adoption of generative AI at least in
                                        the exploration stage.

                                        But people forget that generative AI is still AI; it needs the capability that
                                        any AI would have in terms of strategy, technology, tools, and people. So, it is
                                        highly recommended that executives think about this as part of their overall AI
                                        strategy. One of the ways the strategy has changed is the need for better
                                        governance, shorter roadmaps, and more use cases.

                                        If not treated this way, generative AI and LLMs would remain as isolated and
                                        siloed implementations without much interconnectedness and proper governance.

                                        For now, the three key facets of any GenAI playbook should be: Strategy,
                                        Infrastructure, and Roadmap.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>Generative AI Strategy</h5>
                                    <p class="mb-30">
                                        One of the biggest challenges we are seeing organizations face right now is that
                                        even before reaching the Proof of Concept (POC) stage, most lack a well-defined
                                        strategy and a set of identified use cases. It’s important to identify use cases
                                        with low complexity but high impact and low validation. This might be possible
                                        by creating a matrix of feasibility vs. business value each of them provides and
                                        choosing the right one based on your priorities. Based on which function to
                                        start, which department to work on, and the type of implementation you want,
                                        prioritize the ones that have maximum value. Some of the types of LLM
                                        implementations include:
                                        Use LLM “as-is”
                                        Embed LLM Into an application frame
                                        LLM as chatbot
                                        Use to generate training data for conversational AI
                                        Embed LLM Into a workflow
                                        Document retrieval
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>Infrastructure</h5>
                                    <p class="mb-30">
                                        Even if organizations want to leverage generative AI for insights, they might
                                        not have the right data infrastructure and business processes in place when
                                        implementing AI for practical use. Data quality issues might impact the output,
                                        or your organization’s systems and platforms might have unique needs and
                                        capabilities. What’s more, there might be specific training practices needed for
                                        success. As everyone knows, GenAI is prone to bias and hallucinations; if there
                                        are data quality or training issues, the output would be manifested incorrectly,
                                        to put it lightly.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Because of this, your organization should organize a team with some related
                                        expertise. A team consisting of business experts, engineers, and AI specialists
                                        would work. Obviously, you can’t expect people to have 10 years’ experience with
                                        generative AI, but something close to that – such as people on your data science
                                        team, with LLM or NLP or prompt engineering experience – would be beneficial.
                                        Such expertise will be needed while transitioning from individual inquiries to
                                        production-level applications. Accuracy will be critical, and training on
                                        extensive data sets will become foundational.
                                        <br><br>
                                        One of the main reasons AI projects don’t take off is the lack of leadership, so
                                        you should also ensure someone can pilot the program.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>Roadmap for Deployment</h5>
                                    <p class="mb-30">Once you have the pilot objectives and risks, you can consider the
                                        deployment approach. In the spectrum of build vs. buy, you can either consume
                                        generative AI embedded in applications like Adobe Firefly, Canva’s Editor,
                                        Hubspot Magic Assistant, etc., or build custom models from scratch with the help
                                        of open APIs (for any confidential or sensitive data).
                                        <br><br>
                                        Since each of these approaches has its pros and cons from both a flexibility and
                                        cost point of view, if the objective of building an MVP is to quickly validate
                                        the hypothesis, it is preferable to embed APIs or use applications with GenAI.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>Moving from Proof-of-Concept (PoC) to Deriving Maximum Value</h5>
                                    <p class="mb-30">As C-Suite leaders begin to understand GenAI, they are starting to
                                        uncover some questions: Which use cases will deliver the most value for my
                                        business? And how do we transition from a Proof of Concept (PoC) to full-scale
                                        implementation or enterprise-level deployment?
                                        <br><br>
                                        A lot of the work currently remains in the PoC stage, though some industries are
                                        ahead of the curve, such as chatbots for HR and legal contracts, which have
                                        become relatively common. So, now what remains to be seen is how enterprises
                                        move toward widespread adoption by integrating GenAI into other business
                                        processes.
                                        <br><br>
                                        To move from the PoC to the deployment stage, organizations must identify their
                                        strategy, as we covered earlier, as well as the use cases with high impact.
                                        Prioritizing these use cases based on their impact, cost, data readiness, and
                                        resistance to adoption is essential. Becoming familiar with the limitations and
                                        capabilities will also be important for decision-makers. A roadmap must be
                                        developed, and you must leave room for the possibility of failure. Once this is
                                        done, various PoCs and pilots can be launched, based on the problems an
                                        organization genuinely wants to solve.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Additionally, transparency with your internal stakeholders is key. Communicate
                                        how these changes and the cultural shift will impact them, augment their
                                        capabilities, ensure productivity, and make them more effective. A change
                                        management program right from the start is necessary.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>The Way Ahead</h5>
                                    <p class="mb-30">Going forward, the main differentiator will be how enterprises
                                        deploy foundational models responsibly. Given the cost to train and maintain
                                        foundational models, enterprises will have to decide how they want to deploy
                                        them for use cases. At the PoC level, a lot can be overlooked, but at the
                                        enterprise level, solving business problems will require a degree of certainty
                                        and decision-making around cost, time effort, data privacy, intellectual
                                        property, etc. If a foundational model lacks business context, it can result in
                                        outputs that make it challenging to identify accuracy. Accuracy is a critical
                                        factor – biases and hallucinations are real concerns because most foundational
                                        models are trained on extensive datasets. If there’s an inherent bias in that
                                        data, it will manifest in the outcomes.

                                        There is a huge paradigm shift taking place, one of the biggest in recent
                                        history, and it will impact every aspect of business in the near future. The way
                                        we see it is that at the organizational level, there must be an understanding of
                                        the power of foundational models in a frictionless environment – and this will
                                        be the key to success for many enterprises going forward. </p>
