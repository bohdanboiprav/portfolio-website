                                    <p class="mb-30">At a time when AI is exploding in popularity and finding its way
                                        into nearly every facet of business operations, data has arguably never been
                                        more valuable. More recently, that value has been made clear by the emergence of
                                        AI-powered technologies like generative AI (GenAI) and the use of Large Language
                                        Models (LLMs). But, even with the backdrop of an AI-dominated future, many
                                        organizations still find themselves struggling with everything from managing
                                        data volumes and complexity to security concerns to rapidly proliferating data
                                        silos and governance challenges.
                                        <br><br>
                                        As organizations continue to navigate this AI-driven world, we set out to
                                        understand the strategies and emerging data architectures that are defining the
                                        future. To do this, Cloudera commissioned a study with Foundry, Data
                                        Architecture and Strategy in the AI Era, surveying over 600 IT decision-makers
                                        in North America, northern Europe region of EMEA, and APAC.

                                    <h5>Tapping into AI’s Full Potential</h5>
                                    <p class="mb-30">
                                        It’s not just hype and talk when it comes to AI—a majority of surveyed
                                        respondents (three out of five) said their organizations were at least in the
                                        early stages of adopting AI in their operations while only eight percent said
                                        they had yet to make any plans for AI adoption. And of those organizations
                                        working on some stage of AI adoption, a few of the top benefits included
                                        increased productivity (35%), enhanced operational efficiency (33%), improved
                                        customer experience (33%), and optimized supply chain and logistics (33%).
                                        <br><br>
                                        The benefits are clear, and there’s plenty of potential that comes with AI
                                        adoption. But that doesn’t mean it’s all smooth sailing for organizations
                                        putting AI into practice. Among the most common challenges to achieving AI
                                        adoption at scale were data quality and availability (36%), scalability and
                                        deployment (36%), integration with existing systems and processes (35%), and
                                        change management and organizational culture (34%). Ultimately, when it comes to
                                        reaching the full potential of AI, the organizations that are able to overcome
                                        these complexities and find, classify, and expose data to the right people will
                                        be able to find sustained success at scale.

                                    <h5>Mapping Out the Keys to Success</h5>
                                    <p class="mb-30">
                                        The path to successfully implementing AI at enterprise scale is built on three
                                        critical elements: modern data architecture, unified data management, and
                                        versatile, secure data platforms. Of surveyed respondents, companies that are
                                        leading the way toward AI adoption are focusing on these three areas.
                                        <br><br>
                                        - <b>Modern data architecture</b>: A flexible approach is critical for building
                                        a modern architecture, with IT leaders recognizing the importance of data lakes
                                        or lakehouses for managing the large volumes of unstructured and semistructured
                                        data required for AI model training. In fact, two thirds of respondents agreed
                                        that data lakehouses were crucial to reducing pipeline complexity.<br>
                                        - <b>Unified data management</b>: Survey respondents overwhelmingly (90%)
                                        understood the importance of unifying their data lifecycle on a single platform
                                        as an essential part of analytics and AI. And nearly half (46%) of surveyed IT
                                        leaders said their organization interacts with every stage of the data lifecycle
                                        process. Gaining complete control and visibility into every aspect of data gives
                                        IT leaders the capabilities needed to drive AI-fueled innovation.<br>
                                        - <b>Flexible, secure data platforms</b>: From a long-term perspective, a hybrid
                                        data management approach, including both on-prem and public cloud infrastructure
                                        and data strategy, is the preferred path forward. While only one third of
                                        respondents currently deploy multicloud or hybrid data architectures, 93% of
                                        those respondents agreed that “multicloud and hybrid capabilities for data and
                                        analytics are key for an organization to adapt to change.”<br><br>
                                        The potential of AI is massive and is quickly moving from the theoretical into
                                        actual implementation across a vast number of businesses. And as it does, having
                                        a modern data architecture is proving to be a critical, foundational, part of
                                        successfully scaling the technology and reaching its full potential—something
                                        that the survey results reveal and that IT leaders are acutely aware of within
                                        their own organizations. Ultimately the organizations that successfully
                                        implement AI will be those that are able to demonstrate high levels of
                                        confidence in training data, model integrity, and respect for security and
                                        privacy.
