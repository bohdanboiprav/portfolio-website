                                        also given rise to significant concerns around privacy and safety with respect
                                        to their use. Rogue outputs, poor implementations within business operations,
                                        the safety of information and more are all valid concerns. While the outputs of
                                        such models are a concern, the true essence of the problem lies in the initial
                                        stages of LLM model development and data input.

                                        needs to be considered at the build and input stage of LLM model development,
                                        rather than at the output stage.

                                    <h5>The role of LLMOps models</h5>
                                    <p class="mb-30">
                                        Unlocking success starts with the building blocks of an AI model, and this is
                                        where LLMOps is key. Developing a structured framework that securely stores and
                                        processes data at scale, and is able to safely draw data from other locations,
                                        ensures language models can’t misinterpret information, expose confidential data
                                        or generate potentially harmful answers.
                                        <br><br>
                                        It’s a well-known fact that building an LLM application without a well-defined
                                        Ops model is relatively easy, but this should serve as a warning for businesses.
                                        In the absence of a well-considered, structured Ops model, the infrastructure
                                        that underpins LLMs and AI applications soon becomes challenging to engineer and
                                        maintain in production. Unsurprisingly, this is where things start to go wrong –
                                        the wrong data is utilised and exposed, and models go rogue.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Likewise, these outputs soon become outdated as the process of continuous
                                        retraining and adaptation becomes an uphill battle. LLM models are trained with
                                        static data uploads, also known as batch data, that offers a single data
                                        snapshot from a particular period of time. The accuracy of the LLM model output
                                        is then compromised if the data changes until the next batch upload when the
                                        relevant data points are udpated, making the application unsuitable for
                                        real-time applications.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Without proper maintenance and updates, these models are far more likely to
                                        interpret data in any way they can, producing outcomes biased from their
                                        perception of the past that hasn’t been actualized. Unlike humans who are able
                                        to think critically, problem solve and renew their knowledge in real time,
                                        machines relying on batch data cannot inherently realise where its outputs are
                                        incorrect or questionable. Some technologies are helping LLM models access and
                                        interpret real-time data streams to avoid this issue, but until all LLM models
                                        use this technology as standard, the risks brought by out-of-date LLM models
                                        still stand.
                                        <br><br>
                                        When we strip it right back to the data, what we feed into LLM models is the
                                        first and most crucial step in ensuring safety, for an LLM model is only as safe
                                        and effective as the data it is trained on. For example, feeding arbitrary data
                                        into a model without proper assessment of it would set any business up to fail
                                        at the start line. Safety therefore starts not only in the LLM model framework,
                                        but also in properly considered data pipelines.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>Setting up for success</h5>
                                    <p class="mb-30">
                                        Businesses need to focus on several things to ensure that privacy and safety is
                                        placed at the forefront of any LLM development. For example, an appropriate
                                        foundation for safety should consider the proper recording and documentation of
                                        model inputs and how an LLM has arrived at a conclusion. This helps businesses
                                        to identify and signal what has changed within a model – and its output – and
                                        why.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Similarly, data classification, anonymisation and encryption is a fundamental
                                        aspect of LLM safety, and the same goes for any type of technological model that
                                        assesses information to determine an output. However, many LLM models need to
                                        pull data out of its original location to feed through its own systems which can
                                        put the privacy of this information at risk – take ChatGPT, for example.
                                        OpenAI’s large data breach this summer caused many organisations to panic as
                                        sensitive information that had been stored from employees using ChatGPT was now
                                        at high risk.
                                        <br><br>
                                        As a result, businesses must not only adopt proper data storage and
                                        anonymisation tactics, but also implement supplementary LLMOps technologies that
                                        help companies leverage LLM models without removing their own private data from
                                        its original, internal company location, while understanding potential model
                                        drifts. Leveraging LLM models that can be fed with both batch and real-time data
                                        pipelines from external information sources is one of the most powerful ways of
                                        utilising generative AI, but also for protecting sensitive data from a model’s
                                        occasional faults.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Of course, any responsible use of an LLM model has ethical considerations at the
                                        heart – all of which should underpin every single decision when it comes to
                                        integrating such models. With clear guidelines surrounding LLM use and the
                                        responsible adoption of advanced technologies like AI, these models should be
                                        built in such a way that reduces bias and accountability in decision making. The
                                        same also applies to ensuring model transparency, and knowing the reasoning
                                        behind every decision taken by a large language model.


                                    </p>
                                    <h5>Safety first</h5>
                                    <p class="mb-30">
                                        There is never an ‘easy’ way to implement LLMs, and this is exactly how it
                                        should be. Carefully considered development of these models, and a focus on the
                                        data and training tools used to shape their outputs, should be the focus of any
                                        business looking to implement them.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Forming the foundations of LLM safety is the responsibility of all who have the
                                        desire to build them. Blaming model outputs and attempting to place a bandage on
                                        poor LLMOps infrastructure will not make positive contributions to the safe and
                                        ethical development of new AI tools, and it’s something all should look to
                                        tackle.
